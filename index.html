          My name is Zane and I'm a philosophy graduate who enjoys <a href="https://fleursdumal.org/poem/191">reading</a>, hiking, <a href="https://ziidaelean.bandcamp.com/album/vermilion-void">making music</a>, and cooking. I'm currently learning
          programming because I enjoy the challenge of problem solving and
          I want to make a career out of it. I learned Python and C when I was in university and I am now continuing my learning where I left off. My goal is to become a full-stack or back-end developer and
          then eventually become a software engineer one day.
